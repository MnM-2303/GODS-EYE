The surveillance bot is a four-wheel-drive vehicle controlled using an ESP32-CAM module, enabling real-time video streaming and movement control via a web-based interface. The circuit consists of a 7-12V rechargeable battery, which powers the entire system through a UBEC buck converter. The buck converter steps down the voltage to provide stable power to the ESP32-CAM module, motor driver, and pan-tilt servos. The ESP32-CAM is responsible for live video streaming and Wi-Fi connectivity, allowing remote access through an HTML-based web page.\n
The bot's movement is controlled by an L298N motor driver module, which receives directional commands from the ESP32-CAM. The motor driver controls four DC motors in a differential drive configuration, enabling the bot to move forward, backward, left, and right. Each pair of motors on the left and right sides are connected to separate outputs of the L298N driver. The ESP32-CAM sends signals to the motor driver, which then regulates motor speed and direction accordingly.\n
The camera module is mounted on a pan-tilt mechanism driven by two servo motors. The pan servo allows horizontal rotation of the camera up to 180 degrees, while the tilt servo adjusts the camera's vertical angle. These servos are controlled by the ESP32-CAM, which adjusts their position based on user inputs from the web interface. This enhances the surveillance capabilities by providing a wider field of view.\n
Since the ESP32-CAM lacks a direct USB port for programming, an Arduino Uno is used to upload the required firmware. Once programmed, the ESP32-CAM operates independently, creating a Wi-Fi access point or connecting to an existing network. Users can enter the assigned IP address in a browser to access the web-based control panel. The interface provides buttons for movement control and live video streaming from the ESP32-CAM.
The entire system is designed for autonomous surveillance applications, offering remote monitoring and mobility. The combination of a four-wheel-drive system, pan-tilt camera control, and Wi-Fi-based remote access makes this bot suitable for security, reconnaissance, and industrial monitoring.\n
